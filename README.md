A clean, minimal theme with no frills. Looks great in full screen.

Syntax highlighting shown is not part of the theme.

# Modifications

These are small snippets you can put in your stylesheet to change the theme slightly.

#### Upper dividing line

Creates a thin line between the title bar and the body of the window, as seen in the screenshot.

```Less
atom-panel-container.header {
    border-top: @base-border-color solid 1px;
}
```
